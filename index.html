<h1> The Assault on Women’s Healthcare: A Sinister History of Reproductive Injustice Against Women of Color </h1>
<h3> How women of color continue to face reproductive healthcare injustice despite legal and medical progress </h3>

<div class = "story">
<p> On September 11th, the Trump Administration ordered $10 million worth of birth control pills and other forms of contraceptives to be destroyed, and would no longer be purchased by the United States for low-income nations, falsely claiming that the pills induced abortions. This decision demonstrates the lack of control women, especially women of color, have over their own healthcare and reproductive healthcare needs that impact themselves and their families. Furthermore, on the same day, the U.S. Circuit of Appeals lifted a lower court’s preliminary injunction, allowing Trump to defund Planned Parenthood by blocking them from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid. </p>

<p> The percentage of Black and Hispanic women, who are covered by medicaid for births is 64% and 58% respectively. The destruction of birth control and medicaid restrictions impact women of color the most due to the fact, if they are low-income they rely on both, therefore their healthcare rights are under attack. Systematically they are under not just a pay-gap, but an insurance gap. Without medicaid, access to maternal and reproductive healthcare is limited. </p>

<p> In accordance to the Trump Administration’s advancement of Project 2025, they aim to eliminate coverage for birth control from the Affordable Care Act, encourage legal protection for employers and pharmacists who refuse to provide contraception and reproductive health care by citing personal religious and moral exemptions, “pass a law requiring equal (or greater) benefits for pro-life support for mothers and clarifying abortion exclusions,” suggesting that individuals who seek abortion care or contraception, through their employee benefits, may find themselves with limited or no access to benefits for reproductive health care. </p>

<p> Let's see how women of color have consistently faced reproductive healthcare injustice. </p>
